# Telecom Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression
This repository analyzes telecommunication customer churn using a Logistic Regression model built on data from Kaggle. The project focuses on:
<ul>
<li><b>Data Exploration and Cleaning:</b> Cleaning, visualizing, and understanding the churn dataset.
<li><b>Feature Engineering:</b> Creating and transforming features for better model performance.
<li><b>Multicollinearity Analysis:</b> Identifying and addressing highly correlated features to improve model robustness.
<li><b>Influential Points Detection:</b> Examining data points potentially impacting model predictions.
<li><b>Logistic Regression Model Development:</b> Training and evaluating a Logistic Regression model for predicting customer churn.
</ul>
<b>Key Points:</b><br/><br/>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Source:</b> Kaggle's telecommunication churn dataset.
<li><b>Model Accuracy:</b> 81% accuracy on the test set.
<li><b>Methodology:</b>
<ul><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
<li>Feature Engineering
